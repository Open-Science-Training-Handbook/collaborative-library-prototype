# How to make your own collaborative library prototype!

## Basics

### What you will get

The following steps will enable you to create a website using Github-pages from a Zotero group. If all goes well you will have a website running in less than 30 minutes.

### Before you start

You will need the following: a Github account; Github access via command line or Github desktop; and a Zotero account and desktop client and browser plugin.

Create a Github account and optionally download Github Desktop Client https://github.com/ or Git via command line setup https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/

Create a Zotero account https://www.zotero.org/user/register/ and client and browser plugin https://www.zotero.org/download/

### steps

1. Fork the repository to your user account or organization account https://github.com/TIBHannover/collaborative-library-prototype#fork-destination-box

2. Download a copy to your local machine for editing, see 'Clone or download' button top right of your forked repository.

3. Load your local copy of the collaborative library into your browser. Open the index.html file into your browser. You now have the library running locally.

4. Now you need to get access to the Zotero API to be able to add your own content from Zotero groups into your Github-pages website.

You need to have access to a public group, or make a new group of your own (if it is a group you are admin of you can access private groups). See group access and group creation here on the Zotero website. https://www.zotero.org/groups/

Log into Zotero website and navigate to https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys . Select 'Create new private key' and make your key. Give it a name; uncheck access to your personal account; check 'Per Group Permissions' and give 'read' access to the Group you want to use on your Github-pages website.

Save.

You will be presented with a key number, copy this and keep it in a text editor. If you need to get hold of your key again you can find it in the address of your 'key edit' page. Example key https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys/edit/mSXXZZUo4xiNPM0tQ0XXXXX

5. Next in Zotero we need to access a 'collection' in a 'group'. If you don't have a 'collection' already create one online, go to 'Group Library' link in your online group and top left you can click the button to add a 'collection'. Once you have chosen your 'collection' navigate to its address online in your group, like so https://www.zotero.org/groups/1838445/o-s/items/collectionKey/BHE6RI6Z

There are two parts that you need from this URL to connect your collection to Github-pages. The group number and the collection key. As you can see from the sample address above these will be 'group=1838445' and 'collection key=BHE6RI6Z'.

6. Now to connect your first 'collection' to Github-pages, you will need your API key, group number and collection key. Navigate to the HTML file 'os-library.html' in your downloaded repository directory, open it in a text editor ( like https://atom.io/ ) and go to line 144

`$.getJSON('https://api.zotero.org/groups/1838445/collections/BHE6RI6Z/items?key=mS6PZZUo4xiNPM0tQ0aXXXXX&limit=100&sort=title', function(incomingData)`

Paste in your group number, collection key and API key like so above.

Your locally running website will now be reading the content from your Zotero group's collection. You need to navigate to the first collection from your local home page /os-library.html, reload this page and you will see the changes.

7. Now to load the page into Github and Githib-pages.
